Pheromones are a chemical substance produced and released into the environment by an animal affecting the behaviour or physiology of other of its own species.Â  Although pheromones Are known to play a significant role in signalling between members of the same species among animals to affect various behaviours, it is not clear that is also true in humans. At this stage no conclusive evidence has been found to show the pheromones effect human behaviour.
