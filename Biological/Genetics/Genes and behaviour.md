Genes are segments of DNA inherited by the offspring from the parent. Along with our environment, upbringing and life experiences, genetics have been shown to play a role in determining our behavior. The field of epigenetics explains that in order for a specific behaviour to occur, the gene controlling the behaviour must be expressed. Gene expression is a complex chemical reaction to environmental and physiological changes to allow a gene to do its job. The effect that our environment has on our genetic expression shows the interactionist relationship that genes and our environment have on our behaviour
