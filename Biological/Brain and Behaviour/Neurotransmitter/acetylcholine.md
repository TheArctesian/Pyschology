**Acetylcholine** (**ACh**) is an [organic chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemical "Organic chemical") that functions in the brain and body of many types of animals (including humans) as a [neurotransmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter").Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an [ester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester "Ester") of [acetic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid "Acetic acid") and [choline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline "Choline"). Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as [cholinergic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic "Cholinergic"). Substances that increase or decrease the overall activity of the cholinergic system are called [cholinergics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic "Cholinergic") and [anticholinergics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic "Anticholinergic"), respectively.

In the brain, acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator. The brain contains a number of cholinergic areas, each with distinct functions; such as playing an important role in arousal, attention, memory and motivation.
