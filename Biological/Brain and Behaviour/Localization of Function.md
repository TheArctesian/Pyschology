### Definition 
Localisation is the theory that specific parts of the brain have specific functions that are related to specific behaviours. Often, however, behaviours are quite complex and involve several different parts of the brain. Although specific parts of the brain may have specific functions, they work together with other parts of the brain to create behaviours.
