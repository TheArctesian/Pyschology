The IV varies naturally, the experimenter does not manipulate it but records the effect on the DV. In quasi-experiments the IV occurs naturally such as in a study of gender where males and females are compared. Natural and quasi-experiments are often used when in is unethical to manipulate the IV.

### Advantages 
• Hight ecologic validity
	• Due to the 'real world environment 
• No demand characteristics
	• Often participants are unaware of the experiment so there are no demand characteristics

### Weakness
• Less control
	• More difficult to control extraneous vars
• Replication 
	• Since conditions are never exactly the same it is difficult to repeat field and natural experiments
• Ethics 
	• When participants are not aware it lacks informed consent
• Sample Bias 
	• Since participants are not randomly allocated to groups, samples may be not comparable to each other
