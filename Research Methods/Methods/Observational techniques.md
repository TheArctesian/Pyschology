Involves watching recording and testing behaviour, most being naturalistic but can occur in the real world.
	1. Overt
		Participant observation involves observer becoming actively involved in the situation being studied to gain a more 'hands-on' perspective
	2. Covert
		Non-participant observation involves researchers not being actively involved in the behaviors being studied
	3. Naturalistic Studies 
		Real world study

### Advantages 
• High ecological Validity
	• Most observations occur in natural settings
• Practical method
	• Can be used in situations where deliberate manipulation of vars would be unethical or impractical
• Few demand chars
	• With covert observation 

### Weakness
• Cause and effect
	• Causality cannot be inferred since the vars are only observed
• Observer Bias
	• Observers may see what they want to see 
• Replication 
	• No control so cannot recreate
• Ethics 
	• No informed consent 
• Practical Problems
	• Can be difficult to remain unobserved and there can be problems recording behaviour.
