Experiments that occur in the real world where IV is manipulated with as many other vars controlled

### Advantages 
• Hight ecologic validity
	• Due to the 'real world environment 
• No demand characteristics
	• Often participants are unaware of the experiment so there are no demand characteristics

### Weakness
• Less control
	• More difficult to control extraneous vars
• Replication 
	• Since conditions are never exactly the same it is difficult to repeat field and natural experiments
• Ethics 
	• When participants are not aware it lacks informed consent
• Sample Bias 
	• Since participants are not randomly allocated to groups, samples may be not comparable to each other
