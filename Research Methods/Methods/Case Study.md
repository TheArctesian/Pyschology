The study a particular person, group, or situation over a period of time.  Case studies are technically not a research method - but a combination of research methods.

### Advantages 
• Rich detail
	• Case studies provide great depth and understanding about individuals and acknowledge human diversity.
• The only possible method to use
	• Allows for study of unique behaviours or experiences that could not have been studied any other way. 
• Useful for theory contradiction 
	- Can refute other study

### Weakness
• Not representative
	• As no 2 case studies are alike cannot be generalised
• Researcher bias
	• Researchers conducting case studies may be biased in their interpretations or method of reporting, 
• Reliance on memory 
Case studies often depend upon participants having full and accurate memories
