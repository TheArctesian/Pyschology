Experiments preformed in a controlled environment using standardised procedures with participants randomly allocated to experimental groups

### Advantages 
-   Hight degree of control
	- Experimenters control all vars and the IV and DV are precisely operationalised and measured leading to greater accuracy and objectivity.
- Replication
	- Other researchers can repeat the experiment
- Cause and effect
	- As All vars are controlled the effect (Î”DV) must be caused solely by the manipulation of the IV
-   Isolation of Variables 
	- In the lab, individual pieces of behaviour can be isolated and rigorously tested

### Weakness
-   Experimenter Bias
	- Experimenter's expectations can affect results and participants may be influenced by these expectations
- Problems Operationalising IV & DV
	- To gain precision, measurements can become too specific and not relate to wider behaviour; for example, defining 'getting fatter' as putting 2 kg on in a week
-   Low ecological validity
	- High degrees of control make experimental situations artificial and unlike real life. Therefore, it can be difficult to generalise results to other settings.
-   Demand Characteristic
	- Participants are aware they are being tested and so may unconsciously alter their behaviour
