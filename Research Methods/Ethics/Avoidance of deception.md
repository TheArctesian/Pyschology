Withholding of information or misleading participants is unacceptable if participants are likely to object or show unease once debriefed. Intentional deception over the purpose or nature of investigations should be avoided. Participants should not be misled without scientific or medical justification. If deception occurs, informed consent cannot be gained from participants. It is often necessary that participants do not know the purpose of a study in order to get realistic results. In such case deception must be dealt with in an ethical way. There are a number of ways to achieve this: 
	• Presumptive consent 
		- This is gained from people of a similar background to participants in a study. If they state they would have been willing to participate then it is deemed that the actual participants would too. 
	• Prior general consent 
		- This involves participants agreeing to be deceived without knowing how they will be deceived. As participants know they will be deceived, this can affect their behaviour 
	• Retrospective consent 
		- This involves asking participants for consent after they have participated in a study. 
If deception is used than participants must be told immediately afterwards and given the chance to withhold their data.
