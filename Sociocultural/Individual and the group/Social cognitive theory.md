SCT or SLT 
	• Humans Learn behavior through observational learning-watching models and imitating their behavior
		○ Direct Models: Model is trying to have a direct effect on the learner (teacher modeling behavior that they want students to observe and imitate)
		○ Indirect Models: Not trying to influence   
		○ Do not need direct positive reinforcement/punishment to continue the behavior, if the model was rewarded that is enough (vicarious reinforcement) 

3 cognitive factors 
	• Attention: Person must first pay attention to the model
	• Retention: Observer must be able to remember the behavior 
	• Motivation: Must want to learn
		○ Consistency: If model behaves consistently more likely to imitate 
		○ Identification with the model (in ingroup) 
		○ Rewards/punishment: Vicarious reinforcement through observational learning
		○ Asportation: Do you think it's cool
		○ Self-efficacy: One's  belief in one's ability to succeed in a accomplishing a task
			▪ Low vs High self esteem
