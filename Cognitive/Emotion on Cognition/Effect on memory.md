Definition: In our emotions effect are cogitation in our daily basis, one of the most prevalent ways this happens is through the processes of memory. An example of a form of memory affected by emotion are Flashbulb memories (FM). FM is defined as a highly accurate vivid memory of a monument a person witnesses or hears about a shocking event. While memory has been proven to be a reconstructive process through the various studies done by Tversky and Kahneman, FM break this rule as people have photographic recollection of the event. According to the theory there are 6 important features about FM:

1.  Place
2.  Ongoing activity
3.  Informant (how they learned about the incident)
4.  Own affect ( how they felt)
5.  Other affect ( how others felt)
6.  Aftermath (importance of the event)
