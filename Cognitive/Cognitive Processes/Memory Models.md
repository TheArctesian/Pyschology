### Multi-store model
Definition: The multi store model of memory is proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin inspired by computer science. The multistore model has 3 separate components, sensory memory, short-term memory and long term memory.  The process begins with sensory input, this could be lost due to decay. Memory is process into short term memory through selective attention, if the short term memory is not displaced it is rehearsed and is encoded into long term memory. Long term memory can be returned to STM through retrieval if it is not lost in long term memory.

### Studies
- [[Glanzer and Cunitz (1966)]]

### Working Memory Model
The working memory model suggests that memory is encoded into different stores. Upon receiving sensory input with attention it enters the central executive from which it is processed in different slave systems such as the  visuospatial sketch pad for visual information, the phonological loop for articulatory (inner voice) information and phonological loop as well as the episodic buffer a temporary store holding several sources of information with a limited capacity. These can all be processed into long term memory through rehearsal and can be retrieved into their respective stores.
