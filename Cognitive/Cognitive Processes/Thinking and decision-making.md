Definition: The Dual Process model of thinking and decision making states that humans have two process of thought. The first being System 1 or automatic or intuitive, generally seen as the fast thinking part of the brain concerned with everyday decision making. This system generally is logic based and context-dependent leading it to be very prone to error. System 2 or rational or controlled is more logical and reliable, applying situations from past experiences in conscious reasoning generally taking a more abstract point of view, however system 2 is also slower and requires more effort.
