Â The general concept is that subconscious bias effects the ways we think, found through the decades of research by [[Tversky and Kahneman (1974)]]. The one I will cover is anchoring effect. The anchoring effect is "...a systematic influence of initially presented numerical values on subsequent judgement of uncertain quantities." Meaning that initial number presented will affect your perception of subsequent statistics. The low anchor is easily accessible and is used for judgment by the automatic brain

-   Confirmation Bias
	When people would like a certain idea or concept to be true, they end up believing it to be true

-   Cognitive Dissonance
	Cognitive dissonance is a mental conflict that occurs when your beliefs don't line up with your actions.

-   Anchoring Bias
	Anchoring bias occurs when people rely too much on pre-existing information or the first information they find when making decisions.

-   Just World hypothesis
	The just-world phenomenon is the tendency to believe that the world is just and that people get what they deserve. Because people want to believe that the world is fair, they will look for ways to explain or rationalise away injustice, often blaming the person in a situation who is actually the victim.

-   Optimism Bias
	Optimism bias is a cognitive bias that causes someone to believe that they themselves are less likely to experience a negative event

-   Fundamental Attribution Error
	the tendency for people to under-emphasise situational and environmental explanations for an individual's observed behaviour while over-emphasising dispositional and personality-based explanations

-   Framing effect
	The framing effect is when our decisions are influenced by the way information is presented. Equivalent information can be more or less attractive depending on what features are highlighted.

-   Self-serving bias
	The self-serving bias is the tendency people have to seek out information and use it in ways that advance their self-interest. In other words, people often unconsciously make decisions that serve themselves in ways that other people might view as indefensible or unethical.

-   Dunning-Kruger Effect
	The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate their knowledge or ability in a specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their own skills.
	
-   Barnum Effect
	individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, yet which are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.

-   Halo Effect
	- The halo effect is the tendency for positive impressions of a person, company, brand or product in one area to positively influence one's opinion or feelings in other areas.

-   Sunk cost fallacy
	- The Sunk Cost Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.

-   Illusory correlations
	- illusory correlation is the phenomenon of perceiving a relationship between variables (typically people, events, or behaviors) even when no such relationship exists.

- Availability Heuristic
	- An availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. As follows, people tend to use a readily available fact to base their beliefs on a comparably distant concept.

-   In-group bias
	- In-group Bias (also known as in-group favoritism) is the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others who belong to the same group that they do.

-   Bystander Effect
	- The bystander effect, or bystander apathy, is a social psychological theory that states that individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when there are other people present.
