### Aim
To determine if environmental factors can affect the development of neurons in the cerebral cortex

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
Rats were placed in 3 different environments with adequate assess to food and water for 30-60 days before being dissected. 
1. Control
	Rats were placed in a cage 
2. Enriched 
	Rats were placed in a cage with stimuli 
3. Impoverished 
	Rats were placed in a cage without stimuli

### Results 
The rats in the enriched condition had a thicker and heavier cerebral cortex as well as greater activity associated with the transmission of [[acetylcholine]]. A follow up study showed the same affects when only spending 30 mins in the enriched environment per day. 

### Finding 
Since brain plasticity of rats is assumed to be extrapolable to humans showing human brains are also affected by environmental factors like intellectual and social stimulation  

### Evaluation 
| Benefits | Limitations | 
|--| --|
| Highly Controlled | Rats behavior could not be applicable to humans | 
| Replaceable  |  | 
| Ethical  |  |
