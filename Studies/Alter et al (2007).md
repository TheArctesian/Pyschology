### Aim
To investigate the effect of cognitive disfluency on the use of rational thinking over intuitive thinking

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
Volunteers were randomly split into 2 conditions. In both conditions volunteers were asked to read an article with the first condition having an easy to read font (fluent) and the second condition have a hard to read font (disfluent). They were then told to take a cognitive reflection test on the article they read.
 
### Results
The participants answered more questions correctly when the font was difficult to read.

### Finding 
The disfluent condition required users to activate their system 2 brain causing the participants to use rational thinking in solving the problem

### Evaluation 
Strengths: True experiment with participants randomly assigned

Limitations: An alternative interruption was that participants slowed down making triggering rational thinking
