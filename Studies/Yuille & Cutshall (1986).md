### Aim
To study whether leading questions would affect memory of eyewitnesses at a real crime scene

### Method
[[Field experiments]]

### Procedure 
In Vancouver a robbery and a murdered was witnessed by 21 people. Four months after the event 13 eyewitnesses agreed to be interviewed as part of the study. They were interviewed about the events of that night. The researchers used two leading questions, one group was asked if they saw a broken headlight on the getaway car, the other half was asked If they saw a yellow panel on the car (the panel was blue). The were also asked to rate their stress on the day on a 7 point scale

### Results 
It was found the eyewitness were very reliable being able to recall large amounts of accurate detail that could be confirmed by the original police reports. They also did not make errors as a result of the leading questions. They found the accuracy of the participants was between 79% and 84% .
### Finding 
This contradicts the study by [[Loftus & Palmer (1974)]]. This could be result of the emotional distress causing an adrenaline rush, causing an emotional memory also known as a flashbulb memory as seen in [[McGaugh & Cahill (1995)]].
