### Aim
How memory of a story is affected by previous knowledge.

### Method
[[Longitudinal Study]] Serial Reproduction (reproduce a piece of information across time)

### Procedure 
Bartlett told participants a native American legend called 'The war of the ghosts'. The participants were all British so some of the concepts and names were foreign to them. The participants were then told to reproduce the story after a period of time.

### Results 
Bartlett found participants changed the story in a process now know as distortion. The were three patterns: 
• Assimilation
	The story became more consistent with the participants own cultural expectations.
• Leveling
	The story became shorter with each retelling, omitting information not seen as important.  
• Sharpening
	The story changed order to make sense of it using terms familiar to the participant, with added detail and/or emotions.
Overall participants remembered the themes in the story but changed the unfamiliar elements to match their own cultural expectations. 

### Finding 
This supports scheme theory as it shows how information is distorted in memory,  showing how memories are not copies of experiences but reconstructions from our existing schemes.

### Evaluation 
Limitations: Low ecological validity
