### Aim
The affect genetics have on the human behavior of depression

### Method
[[Correlational studies]], [[Interviews]]

### Background 
Genes are segments of DNA inherited by offspring. Along with environment, genetics have been seen to play a role in behavior. The field of epigenetics explains how genes express themselves. Genes can be changed due to changed in environment showing an interventionist relationship.

### Procedure 
The researchers studied a sample of 15k twins pairs. The twins were tested for their zygosity and then asked if they had had MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) as well as questions on growing up environment 

### Results 
The results showed monozygotic twins had a higher heritabillity the diozygotic, with females having a concordnace rate then males. The study showed environment had no major effect.

### Finding 
This show that MDD is effected by genes, however as the concordance rate is not 100% (44%) there is still an interactionst effect between nature and nurture.
