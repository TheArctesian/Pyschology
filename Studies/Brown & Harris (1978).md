### Aim
how sociocultural factors or environmental factors may play a role in this gender difference.

### Method
458 women in South London were surveyed on their daily life and depressive episodes, with a focus on biographical details. These events were later rated in severity by independent researchers.

### Procedure 

8% of all the women had become clinically depressed in the previous year. 90% of those had experienced an adverse life event (e.g. loss of a loved one) or a serious difficulty (e.g. being in an abusive relationship). Only 30% of the women who did not become depressed suffered from such an adversity. Only four of the 37 women who became depressed had not experienced any adversity.

### Results 

The researchers identified three major factors that affected the development of depression.

1.  **Protective factors** found to protect against the development of depression in spite of stressors, e.g. high levels of intimacy with one's husband. These factors lead to higher levels of self-esteem and the possibility of finding other sources of meaning in life.

2.  **Vulnerability factors** found to increase the risk of depression in combination with particularly stressful life events - called provoking agents in the study. The most significant vulnerability factors were (1) Loss of one's mother before the age of 11, (2) lack of a confiding relationship, (3) more than three children under the age of 14 at home, and (4) unemployment.

3.  **Provoking agents** found to contribute to acute and ongoing stress. These stressors could result in grief and hopelessness in vulnerable women with no social support.

Social class - measured by the occupation of the husband - played a significant role in the development of depression in women with children. Working-class women with children were four times more likely to develop depression than middle-class women with children.

### Finding 

The study showed that social factors in the form of life stress (or serious life events) could be linked to depression. The fact that working-class mothers were more likely to develop depression than middle-class mothers showed risk factors associated with social class. According to Brown and Harris, low social status leads to increased exposure to vulnerability factors and provoking agents, whereas high social status was associated with increased exposure to protective factors and decreased exposure to provoking agents.

### Evaluation 

The study used semi-structured interviews to get an in-depth understanding of the participants' situation as they see it themselves. This increased the **credibility** of the results.

The **sample size** of the original study was relatively large, making the results potentially more reliable.

However, only females were interviewed so the results may not be generalised to men, but the relationship between stressful events and onset of depression might be applicable to men as well.

In addition, this study is based on **self-reporting** of depressive episodes. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine the actual extent of depression for each of the women interviewed.

Finally, this is an example of **correlational research**. Although there appears to be a relationship between stressful events and depression, we cannot determine that it is a cause-and-effect relationship. As other variables are not controlled for, it is possible that biological vulnerability may also play a role in this study. This is what modern research appears to indicate.
