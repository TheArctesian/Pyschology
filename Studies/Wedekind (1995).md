### Aim

### Method
Double blind [[Lab Experiment]]

### Background
Evolutionary psychologists argue that our behaviours are the result of natural selection. One example is mating.  

Wedekind studied a group of genes called the major histocompatibility complex, a group of genes that play a major role in the immune system. MHC diversity results in a stronger immune system.

### Procedure 
A group of men and women were [[Snowball sampling]] and tested for their MHC type. 

Men were asked to wear a t-shirt for 2 nights and abstain from activities that would mutate their natural scent.

The women were asked to smell the shirt through a "smell hole". Of the shirts 3 were of a similar MHC type of the subject 3 were opposite and 1 was unworn for control.

### Results 
Women scored men orders with different MHC type as more pleasant and familiar. 

### Finding 
This suggests that MHC could be detected by scent and it could influence human mate choice.
