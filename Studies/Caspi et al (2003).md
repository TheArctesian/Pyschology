### Aim
Determine whether there is evidence for a gene-enviroment interation for a muation of the serotonin transporter gene - 5-HTT. The serotonin transporter involved in reuptake of serotonin in the brain synapes

### Procedure 
A sample of 847 New Zealand 26 year old were study. This cohort has been assessed for mental health every 2 years from when they were 21. The groups were divided into 3 groups based on 5-HTT alleles. 
The mutation of the 5-HTT gene has shorter alelles

1. 2 short alleles
2. 1 short 1 long
3. 2 Long

The partiipants were asked to fill in a "Stressful life events" [[Questionnaires]] which asked them about the freq of 14 diffrent events such as finanical, eployment, health and relationship stressors and assessed for MDD

### Results 
People with one or more short alleles demonstrated more symptoms of depression and sucidal ideation in response to stressful life evet, strongest in those with 3 or more stressful life events. 
### Finding 
Gene envioment interaction

### Evaluation 
All Bad
- Correlational
	No cause and effect relationship can be determined
- Assumption that [[serotionin]] causes depression
- Some partipants without the mutaiton become depressed 
- Results were holisitc
- Finidngs were not replicated in [[Rish et al (2009)]].
