### Aim
Study the role emotion has in creation of memory

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Background 
When your body goes through a stressful situation your body releases hormones called adrenaline and cortisol from the adrenal gland, this activates the amygdala. The amygdala is know to play an important role in the creation of emotional memory.


### Procedure 
Participants were divided into 2 groups, each saw 12 slides of a story. The first group heard a boring story and the second a traumatic story.

After 2 weeks the participants were invited back in and asked to preform a [[Cognitive Testing]] for memory. 

### Results 
The traumatic group remembered more than the control group.

A follow up study was done with the traumatic group receiving a shot of propranolol, a beta blocked which slows the release of adrenaline. In this test both group preformed similarly 

### Finding 
This study demonstrates that hormones have an affect on memory
