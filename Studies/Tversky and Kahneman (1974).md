### Aim
Test peoples mental shortcuts and biases when making decisions.
### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
95 participants were given a question of probability, regarding probability of distributions, they recorded the participants responses

### Results 
The correct answer was the smaller sample size was more likely to deviate from the mean. However 78% of participants got this wrong with 56% choosing the option saying that the probabilities given the intuitive logic that the probabilities were 50/50 so the using system 1 ignoring the rational answer picked the intuitive choice.

### Finding 
The study shows how participants overwhelmingly picked the intuitive answer rather than the rational correct answer providing evidence for the dual process model.

### Evaluation 
Limitations: Generalisation, low ecological validity, sampling bias
