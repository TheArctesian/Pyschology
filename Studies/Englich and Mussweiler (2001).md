### Aim
Wanted to see if a request for a length of prison sentence would influence the decision made by a judge.

### Method
[[Interviews]] 

### Procedure 
The researchers selected participants with relatively little courtroom experience (medium of 9.34 months). The participants in both condition were given the same rape case. To get a control they consulted 24 senior law students who on average recommended a sentence of 17.21 months. After the participants were given the case materials and the penal code. After going through and forming an opinion on the case, they were given a questionnaire. The first group were told that the prosecutor demanded a 34 months sentence while the other were told that he demanded a 2 month sentence. The following questions were asked.

- Do you think the sentence was too low too high or adequate?
- What sentence would you recommend?
- How certain are you about your sentencing decision (1-9)
- How realistic do you think this case is?
### Results 
When presented with a low anchor of 2 months the mean sentence was 19 months while the given the high anchor of 34 months the mean sentence was 29 months.

### Finding 
This study shows that the numerical value of the anchor dramatically effects the sentencing of a subject. This follow T&K theory of anchoring further showing its judicial applications.

### Evaluation 
Strengths: Indepent measures deisgin, True experiment, Used pilot group in which they demonstrated system 2 thinking while the experiment demonstrated system 1.

Limitations: Small sample size
