### Aim
To determine if brains of london taxi drivers were different from regular people.

### Method
[[Method triangulation]], [[Natural and quasi-experiments]], [[Correlational studies]]

Correlational study as the IV was not manipulated. 

Single Blind as the reaserchers did not know which one they were looking at.

It was Quasi as there is no cause and effect
### Procedure 
16 right handed taxi drivers with over 1.5 years as a driver had their [[MRI]]'s taken and compared with 50 right handed non taxi drivers.

The researchers compared the MRI's with 2 methods. 

-  Voxel Based Morphography (VBM)
	to measure density of grey matter in the brain
- Pixel Counting 
	to determine the size of the hippocampus
	
### Results 
Pixel counting revealed led the postier hippocampus was larger and anterior was smaller. VBM showed the volume of the right postier hippocampus was directly proportional to the amount of years they had been driving



### Finding 
This show that the hippocampus changed due to environmental affects and that it is associated with spacial memory.

### Evaluation 
| Benefits | Limitations | 
|--| --|
| Single Blind | Quasi  | 
| Replaceable | Not representative sample |
