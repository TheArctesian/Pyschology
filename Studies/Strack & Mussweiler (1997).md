### Aim
To confirm the anchoring bias.

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
A group of German males and female university students were split into 2 groups. The first group was asked if Gandhi was older or younger than 9 years old when he died. The second was asked if he was older of younger than 140 years old. They were then asked how old they think he was when he died.

### Results 
Participants in the high anchor condition guessed a medium age of 67, and the low anchor guessed a medium ago of 50.

### Finding 
This study demonstrates the anchoring effect â€“ numerical information given to the participants before making a judgment can influence their later judgements regardless of how ridiculous the numbers are.

### Evaluation
