### Aim
Investigate if articulatory suppression would influence recall of a written list of phonologically dissimilar letter in serial recall.

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]] 

### Procedure 
34 participants were split into 2 groups, control group saw a several list each consisting of 7 letters. The experimental group did the same task while repeating the numbers 1 and 2 at 2 number per second as an articulatory suppression task. They were then asked then scored on the accuracy of their serial recall (letters in correct positions).

### Results 
Experimental group scored 45% and the control group scored 76%

### Finding 
Supports the WMM as description of the phonological loop through the use of articulatory suppression results in less accurate working memory. 

Articulatory suppression prevented rehearsal in the phonological loop due to overload.

### Evaluation 
Strengths: Highly controlled, can establish cause and effect relationship.

Limitations: Low ecological validity.
