### Aim

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]], 

### Procedure
20 health adults were injected with either Scopolamine or a placebo 70 - 90 minutes before taking part in the experimental task.

The participants were then put into an fMRI where they were scanned while playing the "Arena task."  This is a rather complex virtual reality game in which the researchers are observing how well the participants are able to create spatial memories.  The goal is for the participants to navigate around an "arena" with the goal of reaching a pole. After they have learned where the pole is located, the screen would go blank for 30 seconds.  During this time, the participants were told to actively rehearse how to get to the pole in the arena. When the arena reappeared, the participant was now at a new starting point in the arena. The participants would have to use their spatial memory to determine how to get to the location of the pole.

The participants were first trained in the game to make sure that they were comfortable with the use of the joystick and that they understood the rules of the game.  After they were trained, they then took part in the experiment. The participants' brain activity was measured for six trials.

The participants returned between 3 - 4 weeks later and redid the test - receiving the opposite treatment to the original study.  In other words, the study was a repeated measures design.

### Results 
The researchers found that when participants were injected with scopolamine, they demonstrated a significant reduction in the activation of the hippocampus compared to when they received a placebo. 
### Finding 
It appears that acetylcholine could play a key role in the encoding of spatial memories in humans, as well as in rats.

### Evaluation 
Strengths 
- Blindly (controls for [[Researcher Bias]])
- Sample size small
