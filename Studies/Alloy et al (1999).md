### Aim
To investigate how one's cognitive style impacts the development of [[MDD]]

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
A sample of non-depressed college freshman with no other diagnosed disorders was used. Half the sample had a history of clinical depression however demonstrated no symptoms, the other did not have a history of clinical depression.

The students were given a test to measure cognitive style. The students were identified as high risk or low risk for MDD based on their thinking styles. 

The researchers then did follow up assessments every 6 weeks for 2.5 years and every 4 months for an additional 3 years. The study was based on a combination of questionaries and structed interviews to indeifty stressful life events, cognitave style and symptoms of depression. 

### Results 

In the groups with a past history of MDD 26% of HR group relapsed while only 6% in LR group did. 
50% in HR showed sympotms of depresson compared to 26.5% in the LR group. The HR goup had a high rate of suicidality was higher compared to LR (28% and 12.6%)

### Finding 
Negative cognitive style played a role in both onset and relapse. 

### Evaluation
### Good 
- Study used method and data triangulation 
	- Increases the credibiliity of findings
- Test to measure cognitive style
	- Standardized tests with high level of reliability
- Pre/Post test design diminishes bidrectional ambiguity
- Theory has been applied in therapy (CBT), shown to be effective

### Limitations 

- Depressive symptoms were analysed which is not the same as a clincal diagnoses of MDD
- Quasi experiment 
	- Not able to find a cause and effect relationship
- Link between coginitive style and depression may be more complex ([[domino causality]])
