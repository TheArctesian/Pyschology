### Aim
To investigate how dysfunctional thought impact  [[MDD]]

### Method
[[Prospective Study]]
[[Natural and quasi-experiments]]

### Procedure 
A sample of 119 american university students taking an abnomral psychology were compiled with a mean age of 19. 
The stressor of mid-term exams was analysed, the students were assesed 2 weeks before and after the exams. The assetments was comprised of 3 tests. 

1. Dysfunctional Attudes Scale (DAS)
	Measures thinking patterns such as vulnerability, need for approval, perfections and need to impress. Was only taken before the mid term.
2. Cognitive Checklist (CCL)
	Detemine automatic thoughts linking to depresson
3. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
	A standardized assesment to measure levels of symptoms linked to depresson

### Results 
The reasearchers found an increase in the scores on the BDI only in students who had higher scores on the DAS and who failed the exam. Students who had a high DAS score but did well on the exams showed no significant increase in BDI scores. 
Students who had low DAS scores, even if they received low grades, did not experience depressive reactions.

The was a correlation with CCL and having higher scores on BDI and DAS, the BDI score increased if the student failed the exam.

### Evaluation
### Good 
Prospective study allowing reasearchers to see change over time, allowing them to control for bidrectional ambiguity. 

### Limitations 
- Natrualistic, limited control of extraneous vars
- Depressive symptoms were analysed which is not the same as a clincal diagnoses of MDD
- Sampling bias, as the age culture and education could have led to bias in the results.
- Construct validity
