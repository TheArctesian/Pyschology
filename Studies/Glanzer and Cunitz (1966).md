### Aim
To investigate recency effect in free recall

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
The first group was showed a list of 15 items and were told to recall as many groups as possible. The second group were showed the same list with an interfere task on counting backwards.

### Results 
Showed that with no delay effect participants were able to recall the first words of the list and then end of the list demonstrating the primacy effect. The test group could recall the first couple words and could not recall the later items demonstrating the recency effect.

### Finding 
This show supports the multi-store model of memory as the first words are rehearsed and transferred from LTM to STM, the participants in the first group were able to remember the last words as they were most likely still in short term memory, this was not seen in the second group due to the interference showing how the memory is displaced without time to rehearse.

### Evaluation 
Strengths: 
	- The model is supported by memory. 
	- It was the inspiration for the working model of memory

Limitations: 
	- The model is simplistic and can't account for  interactions between different stores
	- Further research showed more stores in LTM
