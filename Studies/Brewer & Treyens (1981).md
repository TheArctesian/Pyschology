### Aim
Investigate the role of schema in encoding and retrieval of episodic memory.

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
Participants were seated in a room that was made to look like an office. The room was decorated to look like an office, however some familiar items were omitted such as books as well as some strange objects such as a skull or toy were added. The participants were told to wait in the office unaware that the experiment had already started. The researched controlled the chair the participants would sit on by placing objects on the other chairs to ensure that the participants all had the same vantage point. After 35 seconds the participants were called into another room then asked what they remembers in the office. After they were given a questionnaire showing that 93% of the participants did not expect to remember the objects in the room. 30 participants carried out written and verbal recognition; 29 preformed drawing recall, 27 carried out verbal only.

### Results 
Participants who were asked to recall either by writing or by drawing were more likely to remember the "expected items", while the more peculiar items were not remembered. When asked to select items on a list they were more likely to identify the incongruent or peculiar items, however they still had a high rate of identifying objects that were schema congruent but not in the room.

In the drawing and verbal they also tended to change the objects to match their schema.

### Finding 
The experiment provides evidence for schema theory as it shows how memory is manipulated to meet our perception of the environment based on based experiences

### Evaluation 
Strengths: Both quant and qualitative data

Limitations: There was a varied list of in inferred items with no explanation for why some were recalled more than others. The researches had no way to verify participants schema. Ethical concerns due to deception, however this was necessary to avoid demand characteristics.
