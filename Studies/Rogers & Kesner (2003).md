### Aim
Study the role of [[acetylcholine]] in the formation of spatial memory
### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
30 rats were placed in a maze and were acclimatised to it with food placed around the maze. They were then split into 2 groups, the first were injected with scopolamine, a beta blocker that block the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The second was injected with a saline solution to control for the potential affects the injection has. They were then sent around the maze and the number of errors was recorded.

### Results 
The experiment showed that the group injected with acetylcholine took longer to go through the maze as well as having more mistakes.

### Finding 
This shows acetylcholine has an affect on the formation of spatial memory

### Evaluation 
| Benefits | Limitations | 
|--| --|
| Highly Controlled | Rats behavior could not be applicable to humans | 
| Replaceable  |  |
