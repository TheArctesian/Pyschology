### Aim
To investigate whether the use of leading questions would affect estimation of speed

### Method
[[Lab Experiment]]

### Procedure 
They set up multiple groups, both were shown a video of a traffic accident. Participants were then asked How fast the car was going with different verbs for example, "How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?" The word hit was replaced by collided bumped smashed and contacted in other conditions.

### Results 
The results showed that the mean speed estimates of each verb were as follows. Smashed 40.8mph, collided 39.3 mph, Bumped 38.1, Hit 34.0, Contacted 31.8.

### Finding 
The research indicates that the framing of the question consistently effected the participants answer. The distortion of memory is based on reconstruction so that it is not the actual details of the accident that are remembered but rather what is in line with a cognitive schema of a severe accident. The interpretation is in line with Bartlett's suggestion of reconstructive memory due to schema Possessing.

### Evaluation 
Strengths: Replicable

Limitations: Low ecological validity
