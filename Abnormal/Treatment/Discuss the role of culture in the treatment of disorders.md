INTRO
Role of culture in treatment is important/manifold
 - how symptoms of mental disorders are experienced, presented, perceived
     - Since the disorder is effected, the treatments are also affected


CENTRAL ARGUMENT
Cultural factors influence the effect of tratments and how treatments are designed.
Psychiatrists must develop culturally sensitive treatments.
There is evidence that culturally sensitive treatments are more effective. (Naeem et al 2012, Griner & Smith 2006)


SUPPORTIVE EVIDENCE I - [[Naeem et al (2012)]]
*In certain communities, there are internal understandings of illnesses that need to be taken into account when developing treatments.

CRITICAL THINKING I  - Naeem et al (2012)

Bottom-up: The culturally sensitive CBT developed was a bottom-up adaptation -> deeper, fundamental changes to the way the treatment is developed -> considering language limiting patients understanding of treatments + local understandings of illnesses -> refocused patients' understandings of somatic symptoms as depression symptoms.

Effectiveness, emic, population validity: This culturally sensitive CBT is in one culture, and thus cannot be generalized to understand whether or not culturally sensitive treatment as a whole is more effective. The study does not have an IV-DV relationship, so they cannot claim any cause-and-effect, which means the effectiveness of the CBT cannot be determined.


SUPPORTING EVIDENCE II - [[Griner & Smith (2006)]]

CRITICAL THINKING II - Griner & Smith (2006)

Sample size: Effectively compares large amounts of bottom-up treatments (adapting treatment based on culture/creating treatment) against large amounts of top-down treatments (cultural sensitivity) and brings out a very significant difference in effectiveness

Construct validity: Effectiveness of each treatment is measured quantitatively, which allows for larger sample sizes, but is a reductionist view of depression treatment and its effectiveness.

Generalizability: Genearl investigation of studies is done objectively, which makes it difficult to gain insight as to why the results are a certain way. Only correlational data. Not sure if it's that the subcultures that bottom-up treatments are used in are smaller and therefore has greater attention to detail and care (and vice versa).
