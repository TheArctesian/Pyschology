## CBT
A blend of cognitive therapy and behavioural therapy. Restructuring automatic negative thoughts. Adjusting maladaptive behaviours. 

**Aaron Beck** (1921-2021). Psychological problems are associted with maladaptive thinking patterns and unhealthy behaviours that can be changed through a working relationship between the client and a therapist. 

It is not specific ecents that are at the core of an individual's problem but rahter the way it is produced 

>"Man is troubled not by events, but by the meaning he gives them" - Epictetus

### Aims
1. Help the client to identify and change faulty thinking patterns and unhealthy behaviours
2. Help the client to develop effective coping strategies and problem-solving and problem-solviing skills

## Goal 
Cognitive restructuring to identify the dispute irrational of maladaptive thoughts known as cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking, over generalisation, magnification or arbitrary inferences. Cognitive Restructuring employs many strategies: 

1. **Validity testing**: The therapist ask the client to defend his of her thoughts and beliefs by giving concrete evidence to support that these beliefs are rooted in experience. If the patient cannot produce objetive evidence supporting his or her assumptions the faulty nature of these beliefs is exposed. 
2. **Cognitive Rehearsal**: The client is asked to imagine a difficult situation he or she has encountered in the past, and then works with the therapist to pratice how to successfully cope with the problem. The goal is that the client would be able to transfer cognitive rehersal to coping with the real situation when it occurs again in the future. 
3. **Homework**: In order to encourage self discovery and reinforce insights made in therapy, the therapist may ask the patients to do assignments. These may include therapy 
	1. Journalling
	2. Review of an audiotape of therapy session 
	3. Reading articles 
	4. Monitor his her own behaviour, ie: writing down everything you did that made you feel good.


## Cognitive Distortions 
1. All of Nothing 
2. Overgeneralisation 
3. Mental Filter 
4. Disqualifying the positive 
5. Jumping to conclusions
6. Magnification or Minimisation 
7. Emotional Reasoning 
8. Should statements 
9. Labeling and Mislabelling 
10. Self-Blame and Other-Blame 

Replace this with A more rational Response 

## Rational Response
1. Identify the Distortion
2. Examine the Evidence 
3. The double standard method
4. Thinking in Shades of Gray 
5. The Survey Method 
6. Define Terms 
7. The Semantic method 
8. Re-attribution 
9. Cost-Benefit Analysis

Strenghts 
- Lower relapse rates [[Rush et al (1997)]]
- Non generic treatment and can be specific to the client 

Limitations 
- [[Elkin et al (1989)]] found no diffrence in effectivness. 50% improved in each condition. 
- Does not address the potential biological nature of the disorder 
- Addresses the symptoms rather than on the causes 
- Ethical conserces in questioning the 'rationality' of the client 
- Psychological treatments take a lot of time to start showing improvments 
- There are some concerns that much individialized therapy is based on individualistic culture and not collectivistc. Research needs to be done to determine the extent of cross-cultrual applications of the therapy
