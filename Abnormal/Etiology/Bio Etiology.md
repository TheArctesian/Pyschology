1. Genetics 
	- Pedigree (family) studies
		- Limitation: Could share environmental factors
	- Twin Studies 
		- [[Kendler et al (2006)]]
	- Adoption studies 
	- Associative (Linkage studies) 
		- Identify genes that link to depression in a family
	- GWAS (Genome wide association studies)
		- Tracking genetic markets 
		- [[Caspi et al (2003)]]
- Strengths 
	- Highly reliable, high concordance rate in monozygotic twins
	- Allows us to locate genetic variations using large sample size (GWAS)
	- Is not solely reductionist 
- Limitations 
	- Correlational studies do not establish a cause and effect rel
	- Twin studies have the problem of population validity 
		- Generalising from twins to no twins 
	- Impossible to isolate vars 
	- Genetic args do not account for the variation in symptomology in different cultures 
	- It is not yet clear how genetic markets interact 
2. Serotonin Hypothesis  [[Neurotransmission]]
	Strengths
		- Altering serotonin level by diet leads to depressive symptoms in formerly depressed patients
		- 5-HTT gene in [[Caspi et al (2003)]] is responsible for serotonin transport 
		- Some patients taking SSRIs show improvement in symptoms 
	Limitations 
		- We cannot directly measure serotonin in the brain 
		- Deliberate attempts to decrease serotonin in non-depressed patients to induce depressive symptoms have not worked
		- Not all people with depression are successfully treated by SSRIs
		- Not all sympomtsm of depression can be explained by low serotonin level
3. Cortisol Hypothesis [[Hormones]]
	Also called the neurogenesis theory of depression, this is a complex theory that looks at the role of HPA axis in the development of depression 
		- Argues that depression is the result of the cessation of neuron birth in the hippocampus as well as in other neural networks related to serotonin dopamine and norephinphrine. 
		- Cortisol appears to be the reason for the lack of neurogenesis. Patients with major depressive disorder display a symptom called __HPA-axis hyperactivity__ that results in the over secretion of cortisol
