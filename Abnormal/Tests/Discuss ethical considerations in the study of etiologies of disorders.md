## Intro
1. [[MDD]]
	Major Depressive Disorder is an affective disorder that results in feelings of sadness, difficulties in decision-making and memory, loss of motivation and suicidal ideation. 
2. Etiologies 
	Researchers try to determine the cause of MDD using various diffrent reasearch methods 
3. Ethical Considerations
	While conducting this reasearch, researchers need to consider a number of diffrent ethical issues that may be relevant
## Central Argument (K&U)
Ethical considerations relevant to studying etioleges of MDD
1. [[Confidentiality]]
2. [[Psychological Harm]]
3. [[Informed Consent]]
	

## Evidence 
[[Kendler et al (2006)]]
- How did they get their sample, Informed Consent 
- Asking about neg life experience cause stress, Psychological harm
- Identities and characteristics, Confidentiality 
[[Caspi et al (2003)]]
- Quasi experiment, because gene manipulation would cause harm
- Harm to participants if you do or don't tell them. 
	If yes, then will possibly cause them to assume regular life events are MDD 
	If no, will not be able to develop protective factors 

## Synthesis 
Ethics limits the depth of knowledge 
Important for protecting participants and for keeping participants
