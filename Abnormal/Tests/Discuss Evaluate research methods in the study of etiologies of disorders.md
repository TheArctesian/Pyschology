When studying the prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder, we see that women are twice as likely to develop depression as men. Arguments in the past used to focus on hormonal differences as the source of this difference, but many studies of hormones have not demonstrated a clear link to depression.Â  Brown & Harris decided to look at how sociocultural factors or environmental factors may play a role in this gender difference.
